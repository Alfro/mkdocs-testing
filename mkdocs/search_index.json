The recommended distribution is Ubuntu 16.04. Make sure that the version chosen matches your system architecture (32 or 64 bits).\n\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\nThe latest Galicaster version can be downloaded \nhere\n, as a DEB package. Older versions and information about the new features that each of them included are available on the \nRelease Archive.\n\n\nBy downloading, you agree to the \nnon-commercial license\n. \n (Commercial licenses also available under request)\n\n\nSource code\n\n\nAs an alternative to the DEB package installation, you can install Galicaster from the source code. Stable versions are available on the \nRelease Archive.\n. Stable and development versions, as well as development information, are available in our \nGit repository\n.\n\n\nInstalling a source code version requires installing its \ndependencies\n manually.\nIf a DEB package installation is also present, conf.ini and the profiles will be read from the folder /etc/galicaster. Otherwise, the ones in the installation folder will be used.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a launcher\n\n\nYou can easilly add a launcher to a manual installation by creating a file at \n/usr/local/bin/\n containing the following command:\n\n\n\n\npython <path>/run_galicaster.py\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nUsing Galicaster repository\n\n\nInstallation instructions using the galicaster repository are as follows:\n\n\nRemember to install the system using the galicaster user per default.\n\n\necho \"deb https://packages.galicaster.org/apt xenial main\" | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/galicaster.list\nwget -O - https://packages.galicaster.org/apt/galicaster.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install galicaster\n\n\n\n\nIf you are \nupgrading from a previous 2.0 version\n, you just need to execute\n\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install galicaster\n\n\n\n\nManual install deb package\n\n\nThe Ubuntu Software Center  will install the DEB package by simply double-clicking on it. Both the Galicaster software and the dependencies will be installed.\n\n\n\n\n\ufffcThe Ubuntu Software Center shows a warning because Galicaster does not strictly follow the .deb standards. You can safely ignore it and continue the installation.\n\n\n\n\nYou may also run the following command on a shell (needs root permissions):\n\n\ndpkg --install <galicaster_$version_all.deb>\n\n\n\n\nGalicaster will be installed in \n/usr/share/galicaster\n . The configuration files and profiles folder will be placed at \n/etc/galicaster/\n. In order to get Galicaster ready to go, it would be useful running this command to put the right file owners:\n\n\nsudo chown -R <user>:<group> /etc/galicaster\n\n\n\n\nNew profiles can be added in \n/etc/galicaster/profiles\n. For more information about them, refer to the \nInput Profiles section\n.\n\n\nYou may remove Galicaster from your system using the Ubuntu Software Center or the following command on a terminal:\n\n\ndpkg --remove galicaster\n\n\n\n\nThe files at \n/etc/galicaster\n will not be removed, thus preserving your configuration. If you also want to delete them too, run this instead:\n\n\nsudo rm /etc/galicaster/profiles/*.*\nsudo dpkg --purge galicaster\n\n\n\n\nDependencies\n\n\nGalicaster depends on the following modules and libraries:\n\n\npython python-pip python-setuptools python-pycurl python-bottle python-glade2 python-icalendar python-gi python-dbus python-simplejson\ngstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-libav\ngir1.2-gstreamer-1.0 gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-gst-plugins-base-1.0\nonboard onboard-data\n\n\n\n\nFor testing devices, specially webcams and V4L2-compatible devices, other software may be installed as well:\n\n\n\n\nguvcview (apt)\n\n\n\n\nRun Galicaster for the first time\n\n\nOnce installed, Galicaster is ready to run. You may start Galicaster by:\n\n\n\n\nOpening a terminal and executing galicaster.\n\n\nFind Galicaster under Applications in the Unity Menu.\nYou can also add Galicaster to your Unity sidebar, place a link at the Desktop or include it as a startup application.\n\n\n\n\nThe default input Profile consists of two mock video sources and a mock audio source.
